# Friday Night Funkin' - P-Slice Engine
This engine was originally meant to be a playground for making Psych Engine compatible with linux, but after some attempts in porting V-Slice content became a crossover between Psych Engine and V-Slice (also known as base game).

For more info please refer to the README on the "master" branch.
